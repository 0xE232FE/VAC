# VAC üõ°Ô∏è
This repository contains parts of source code of Valve Anti-Cheat recreated from machine code.

## Introduction
Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) is user-mode noninvasive anti-cheat system developed by Valve. It is delivered in form of modules (dlls) streamed from remote server. `steamservice.dll` handles module loading.

## Encryption / hashing
VAC uses several encryption / hashing methods:
- MD5 - hashing data read from process memory
- ICE - decryption of imported functions names and encryption of scan results
- CRC32 - hashing table of WinAPI functions addresses
- Xor (?)
